# Python Neural Network
This repo contains my work, trials, documentation, notes, code, etc. as I learn 
more about programming and working with neural networks. 

## About
Lately I have been very intrigued by AI and the future of technology (and the
world) as AI becomes more and more prolific. I love AI and all the possiblities
it brings forth and I want to become more versed and experienced with AI. So,
with that in mind, I have set out to learn how to create and use AIs. 

I have decided to start this journey by learning about neural networks. This
was spearheaded by a blogpost that I read about creating a simple 'toy' neural
network in python. Starting with that post, I am moving forward trying to learn
about how neural networks work, how to create them, and really just everything
that I can learn about them. 

I am documenting my progress here. That includes notes, code examples,
documentation, and anything else that I can catalogue along the way. I do this
with the hopes that it will not only help me to learn better, but that my work
can possibly help someone else learn about these topics in the future. 

I will also be posting on my blog throughout the journey documenting what I
have learned. I will add those posts here, but they will also be accessible
on my [blog](https://blog.bwinterton.com) if you want to follow along there!

## Resources
I have documented the resources that I found useful along the way in 
[`resources.md`](resources.md).
